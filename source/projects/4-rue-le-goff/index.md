# 4 Rue le Goff

This 170 sf micro-apartment renovation in the heart of the 5ème arrondissement in Paris examined the city's growing exclusivity. The client goal was to expand function, square footage and usability of the space so that it would attract a larger and diverse tenant group. The design focused on improving the kitchen to support daily intensive use, stripping the bathroom of all unnecessary function and removing the 8' false ceiling in order to open up the space for a sleeping loft. The separation of bedroom and living as well as the addition of a functional kitchen were the primary programmatic interventions. The loft stairs dually act as storage and are kept open in order to enhance visual transparency.
