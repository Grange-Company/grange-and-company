# Eliot Table

The Eliot Table is a durable and solid object that examines concepts of movement, juxtapositions of material, and unusual geometries. The table at first glance seems to present a quotidian utilitarianism, but gives way to subtle
explorations of the craftsmanâ€™s art on closer examination. Designed by Celia Beauchamp from Grange, and built by CBWS from sustainably harvested Western Red Maple and Eastern White Maple.

The companions to the Eliot Table are the Eliot Benches - alluding to the craftsman style while maintaining a slim profile, the Benches provide pragmatic support and formal contrast, bringing out the subtle geometries and material
juxtapositions of their larger counterpart. The Eliot Benches are designed and manufactured as their counterpart table, using carefully considered cast-off and spare materials.
