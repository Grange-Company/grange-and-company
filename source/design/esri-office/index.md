# GIS Tech Office Furniture

Grange + Company worked with this large global tech company on space planning, furniture design and fabrication for their new Research and Development office in Portland, Oregon. The space planning and furniture design phases were two-fold and developed at the same time, creating unique and site-specific furniture for the company. Grange designed standing desks, bookshelves and a reception desk to bring Portland and Oregon's natural and cultural history into an otherwise corporate-style environment. All three furniture typologies strive to challenge traditional conventions of corporate workplace furniture.

> The client wanted different height desks, with the ability to occasionally adjust the height - Grange implemented a manual peg system that was simple and cost-effective.
