# Loading Dock

How can design, beauty and function be balanced in the entryways of domestic life? The Loading Dock is many things - an artful object, a shelf, a coat rack, a key finder, a shoe rack, and a recipient for everyday things that we continuously interact with. The object's utilitarian spirit draws from the need to keep life simple and contained in a beautiful and interesting way. This furniture piece was hand crafted from old growth fir and is currently available in all native hardwood species of Oregon.
