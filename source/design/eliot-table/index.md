# Eliot Table

The Eliot Table is a durable and solid object that examines concepts of movement, juxtapositions of material, and unusual geometries. Western Red Maple and Eastern White Maple. The companions to the Eliot Table are the Eliot Benches - alluding to the craftsman style while maintaining a slim profile, the Benches provide pragmatic support and formal contrast.
