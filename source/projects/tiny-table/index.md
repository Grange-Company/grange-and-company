# Tiny Table

A side table that reflects the movement towards small and reduced living, and speaks to mid-century French and contemporary Scandinavian design concepts. Tiny Table was manufactured using traditional woodworking methods from cast
off and extra materials from the first Loading Dock prototype. Finding a new life cycle for what are normally considered ‘scraps’ speaks to Grange’s commitment to sustainable practice and responsible design.
